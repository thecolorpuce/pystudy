#4-2. Animals: Think of at least three different animals that have a common char-
#acteristic. Store the names of these animals in a list, and then use a for loop to
#print out the name of each animal.

animals = ['dog','cat','pig','fox'] 

for animal in animals:
    print(f"{animal.title()}s have ears")
    
print("All of these animals have ears!")
