12-3. Pygame Documentation: We’re far enough into the game now that you
might want to look at some of the Pygame documentation. The Pygame home
page is at https://www.pygame.org/, and the home page for the documenta-
tion is at https://www.pygame.org/docs/. Just skim the documentation for now.
You won’t need it to complete this project, but it will help if you want to modify
Alien Invasion or make your own game afterward.
