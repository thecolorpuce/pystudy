#5-1. Conditional Tests: Write a series of conditional tests. Print a statement
#describing each test and your prediction for the results of each test. Your code
#should look something like this:

car = 'subaru'

print("is this car == 'subaru'?")
print(car == 'subaru')

print("\nis car == 'audi'?")
print(car == 'audi')

#This wants me to do this 10 times, but it's pretty easy to grasp.
#Moving on!
