#6-11. Cities: Make a dictionary called cities. Use the names of three cities as
#keys in your dictionary. Create a dictionary of information about each city and
#include the country that the city is in, its approximate population, and one fact
#about that city. The keys for each cityâ€™s dictionary should be something like
#country, population, and fact. Print the name of each city and all of the information 
#you have stored about it.
